                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, then coat with
                        mixture of almond flour and arrowroot. Shake off excess.
                    </li>
                    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons ghee or butter with 3 tablespoons
                        olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. When
                        liquid starts to sizzle, add both pieces of chicken.
                        Cook until chicken is browned, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip
                        and cook other side additional 2 1/2 minutes. Remove
                        chicken and transfer to plate.</li>
                    <li>Add garlic to skillet and stir several times, then add
                        the lemon juice, chicken stock, and capers. Bring to a
                        boil, stirring occasionally to mix any seasoning that
                        may be at bottom of skillet. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add chicken breasts to lemon mixture. Flip to coat. Cook
                        about 30 seconds. Remove chicken and serve over the
                        starch of your choice. Garnish with parsley.</li>
